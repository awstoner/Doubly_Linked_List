1. reverse()
reverse() begins by constructing a List object named temp. This is O(1) time. It is just assigning values to member data.
Then a for loop is next, which calls begin() and end() in the definition of the loop itself which are both O(1) time, as well as
the iterator increment operator overload++, which is also O(1) time.
Inside the loop's body, the copy version of function push_front() is called, and passes in a dereferenced iterator.
The dereference operator overload I believe is also O(1) time, as it is just retrieving the data the current pointer is
pointing to, no searching required. push_front() calls upon insert(), which I believe is O(1) time as well. It is just creating new pointers and assigning
existing values to those pointers.
Finally, the move assignment operator is used to move the resources from temp to the calling object List.
I believe this is O(1) time, because each move is will transport all necessary member data
in one fell swoop. Therefore, the time complexity is O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + O(n) * O(n) = O(n). I am probably missing some O(1)'s in there but the final answer is
a time complexity of O(n).

2. remove_if()
remove_if() begins by constructing an iterator and initaliazing it with begin() and the copy assignment operator. This is O(1) time. It then
begins a while loop, checking equality between the iterator and end(), then a nested if statement calling upon the parameter pred, and *itr. And within that
there is erase(itr). Outside of the if statement, the iterator is incremented. I believe that the while() statement provides an O(n) time, * the time complexity
of pred * the time complexity of erase(). Therefore, I believe the time complexity of this function depends on the predicate that is passed through which passes the
dereferenced itr. I believe the function's time complexity equals O(1) + O(n) * O(1) * O(1) + O(1) = O(n).
